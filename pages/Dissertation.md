# Women and Wool Working in the Roman Empire

## Dr. Morgan A Lemmer Webber, University of Wisconsin Madison, Spring 2021 

### Abstract

This dissertation looks at women’s roles in textile production in the Roman
Empire, from the first through third centuries C.E., utilizing archaeological,
epigraphic, literary, administrative, and visual evidence. The sites of Karanis, Trier,
and Ephesus are used as case studies to focus analysis alongside domestic,
commercial, and performative lines. Scholars have often viewed the domestic and
commercial divide in textile production along gendered lines, associating domestic
production with women in the context of the ideal of feminine virtue and
commercial production with men working in centralized production centers. This
study uses the cottage industry model to explore the role of women’s labor in the
Roman textile industry, exploring the links between domestic production and
commercial distribution.
