I first set up this website in 2018 and have barely updated it in the interim. Fresh off of our Digital Humanities workshops, which used scribble and racket, I decided to use frog (racket's static site generator) because the the content could be formatted using scribble. 

Now that I finally have some down time post-dissertation I figured it was finally time to update things. As I am brushing up my resume, I am reviewing my python skills and decided to migrate this site to pelican (a static site generator using python). I've previously written my own (entirely overly complex and unneccessary) static site generator using python and Jinja2, so pelican seemed like a good skill to add to my toolbox.
