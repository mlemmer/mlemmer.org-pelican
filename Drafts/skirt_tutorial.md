Since I'm teaching Christine how to sew, it felt like an ideal time to make my first official Free Soft Wear pattern! We're starting with a few simple patterns but what she really wants out of this, is more pretty skirts. This is my favorite simple skirt pattern that I've been using for a couple of years and now I want to share it with you all!

This is really more of a tutorial than a pattern. I don’t have all of your measurements, I don’t have the patience to figure out standard sizing, and it's more fun if you can customize it to your taste. So I’m going to give the basics and you can make your skirts custom to you!

## Supplies needed:
- Scissors capable of cutting two layers of fabric
- A soft tape measure (or string/yarn + a rigid tape measure/yardstick/ruler/etc)
- Straight pins
- 1 large safety pin (2" or larger is ideal, but you can work with what you have)
- Something to mark out your pattern (ideally this would be a fabric marker/pen/chalk which will disappear or wash out easily. If you don’t have access to this, you can mark your pattern out on butcher/craft/postage paper and pin it to the fabric to cut out. If you don’t have access to that, you can use a regular pen or marker, but that may leave some visible marks on your final product)
- A mode of sewing (I’m using a sewing machine but if you don’t have a machine, this can be sewn by hand with a needle it’ll just take longer)

## Materials:
- 2-3 yards of fabric depending on the size and fullness of the skirt you want (If you want to make this for a child it’ll be less! You might want to do your measurements to calculate how much fabric you will need before you purchase your supplies since I’m not giving precise measurements)
- 1” elastic for waistband
- Thread 

## Measurements
- Before you start, you should figure out what size of seam allowance you feel comfortable with, usually between 1/4" and 1/2". Whatever you use, you should factor in your seam allowance to your measurements and remain consistent. There are often markers on sewing machines to help you keep this consistent. 
- Measure your waist: 
    - First, use your soft tape measure or string to measure your waist
    - Since this is an elastic waistband skirt, you want the fabric of your skirt to be larger than the final desired measurement so that the elastic has space to stretch. I usually add ~3" or the width of my hand to my waist measurement. Before you cut your fabric, make sure you the waist measurement you've chosen will have enough space for the waistband to clear your hips. 
    - Add in your seam allowance for each side
    - Example: if your actual waist measurement is 30", and you're doing 1/4" seams, you want to cut your fabric to add up to at least 33.5"

- Measure length:
    - Figure out where on your waist you want the skirt to sit (high-rise, waist, hips) and how long you want it to go (mini, knee-length, full length). Then use your tape measure or string to measure the length from where you want your waist to be to where you want the skirt to fall on your leg. This step is much easier if you've got an extra person to give you a hand
    - Add ~1.5" to make a chanel for the elastic to fit into at the waist
    - Add at least double your seam allowance to do a double fold hem so it doesn't frey. If you want a bit more leeway, leave a larger amount of space on the length because you can always hem it up, but once it's cut there's only so much you can do to make it longer. 
    - Example: You want a full-length skirt, the distance from your waist to your ankle is 46", and you're doing 1/4" seams (x2 for the double fold hem), you want to cut your length to 48"


## Figure out the angle of your side seams
- The bigger the bottom circumfance of your skirt is in relation to your waist size (determined by the angle of the side seam), the fuller your skirt will be. I'm usually fairly lazy and don't plan too cautiously, so I usually just buy 2-2.5 yards of fabric, center my waist measurement, and make the bottom circumference as wide as possible.
- If you want pockets from the same material and you don't have enough extra material to accommodate that, you can use the extra triangle of fabric to make those pockets if the angle of your side seam is big enough

## Prepare your fabric
- Pay attention to your fabric pattern. Is there a design that needs to be facing a specific direction? Keep that in mind when you're laying out your pattern if you don't want your dogs/cats/dinosaurs/whatever to be upside down or sideways. 
- Fold the fabric in half with right-sides facing (i.e. you'll be marking your pattern on the 'inside' of the skirt)
- Mark out your pattern using your tape measure/string and marking implement (see diagram)
- Place pins about an inch inside of the cut lines so that the fabric doesn't shift as you cut.

## Cut your pattern, you will have 5 pieces:
- 2 skirt panels
- Material for 2 pockets, one will be in two pieces, the other will have a fold. For consistency, cut the fold so that both pockets are the same

## Assemble pockets
- Sew along side and bottom (right angle) of each pocket and about 1/3 of the way up the diagonal side. 

## Attach pockets to skirt panels
-  Lay out skirt panels with right sides facing.
-  With wrong sides facing, put the pockets between the two skirt panels. Align the short side of your pockets with the waistband and the diagonal side with the sides of your skirt panels. Sew one side of pocket to the front skirt panel and the other to the back skirt panel

## Sew side seams of skirt
- With right sides facing, sew side seams of skirt together starting below the seams for the pocket to the bottom of the skirt.
- If you have a tag you want to incorporate into the skirt, you can pin it into the seam on one of the wrong-sides of the skirt. 

## Secure pockets to the front of the skirt
- Choose which skirt panel will be the front of your skirt
- Topsew along the seam of the pocket and skirt panel
- Sew the top of the pocket to the top waistline of the skirt

## Make waistband
- Single hem along the waistline of the skirt (fold over to your seam allowance and run a straight stitch over it)

- Fold again leaving a channel large enough to fit your elastic waistband through (if you are using 1" elastic, fold to 1 3/8" this give you enough space for a 1/4" seam allowance and an 1/8" margin of error). Run a straight stitch at the bottom of the waistband leaving a 1 1/4" gap in this seam.

- Guage the size of waistband by wraping the elastic around your waist and tightening it to the level that seems comfortable to keep the skirt where you want it. Leave a 1" allowance and cut to size.

- Use a flat pin to attach one end of elastic to your skirt panel outside of the gap in your waistband seam. Attach the safety pin to the other end of your elastic, feed it through the gap in your waistband seam. Use the safety pin to feed the waistband through the channel until it emerges again through the gap.

- Make sure that your elastic is not twisted inside of the waistband.

- Overlap your 1" allowance on your waistband and sew several parallel lines within that inch to secure the elastic (since elastic stretches, this is an easy point of failure if you only do one point of attachment).

- Feed the seam back into the channel and close the gap in your seam

- Even out the distribution of gathers in the waistband so that it is even across the skirt. Start by stretching the waistband as far as it will extend, then manually even out any additional areas where necessary.

## Try it on!
- If you are making the skirt for yourself or someone in the vacinity, this is a good time to turn the skirt right side out and try it on to guage the fit of the waist and the length of the skirt.

## Double Hem the bottom of skirt
- Fold hem once to seam allowance, run a straight stitch to secure.
- Fold hem to the the length of skirt you prefer. 

## Cut all of your loose threads.

## Try skirt on. If anything doesn't quite look right, don't be afraid to rip your seams and redo (I probably spend more time ripping than sewing).
